# StellaSpec
StellaSpec is ment to be a ready-to-use MRSI data analysis pipeline. This project has been created by a master thesist at the IRCCS Stella Maris and IMAGO7 research center.

The scripts "simseq" and "simulation" have been modified from the open-source software "fsl_mrs" (Clarke, W. T., Stagg, C. J., & Jbabdi, S. (2021). FSL‐MRS: An end‐to‐end spectroscopy analysis package. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 85(6), 2950-2964.) while "proc_autophase" has been modified within the open-source software "nmrglue" ("Helmus, J. J., & Jaroniec, C. P. (2013). Nmrglue: an open source Python package for the analysis of multidimensional NMR data. Journal of biomolecular NMR, 55(4), 355-367."). These screepts need to be sobstituted in order to generate the signal from 31P and phasing it graphically.

Other dependencies are reported in the "requirements" file.
